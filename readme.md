# Hot Reloading CLI Script

This is a script which can be used to enable code/file watching operations on OSX & Linux machines. I have not tested this script on Windows.

This script can either be ran via `deno run -A main.ts` or built as a platform dependent executable via `deno compile -A main.ts`.
