# Hot Reloading CLI Script

This is a script which can be used to enable code/file watching operations on OSX & Linux machines. I have not tested this script on Windows.

This script can either be ran via `deno run -A main.ts` or built as a platform dependent executable via `deno compile -A main.ts`.

You can also run the script with **deno** like so: 
```bash
deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaceby/hot-reload/main/main.ts
```
